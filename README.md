## Key Learnings

While working on this project, I gained valuable experience in:

- Implementing event listeners to capture and respond to user interactions.
- Dynamically manipulating the DOM to update and modify elements in real-time.
- Creating different drawing and shading modes to encourage creative expression.
- Utilizing JavaScript to manage grid behaviors and implement visual effects.
- Enhancing the user experience through responsive design and interactive features.
